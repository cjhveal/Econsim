# Econsim
Econsim is a simple trade simulator. I started this project with the
intent to learn about economics, as well as data visualization.

### TODO
* Build rake tasks to stitch frames with gificle or imagemagick's animate and cleanup after.
* Allow trading of neutral
* Give an incentive for collecting (increased production?)
