# Econsim
Econsim is a simple trade simulator. I started this project with the
intent to learn about economics, as well as data visualization.

I built this simulator without any economic background. I am simply
building an arbitrary system to examine its consequences.

### TODO
* Build rake tasks to stitch visualization frames with gificle or imagemagick's animate and cleanup after.
* Allow trading of neutral resources
* Give an incentive for collecting (increased production?)
* Seperate resources from Agents
* Separate production sources from Agents.
* Corporations: collections of agents that pool resources for some edge.
